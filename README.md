# Forager Redesign

## Focal Points

### Search

- Is the search just for existing articles? If so, I feel like there aren't like enough that are on the website to really justify it but idk.
- Do you want this search to be a focal point of the site, like how much do you expect users to search stuff? Placing it like nav menu vs just on articles page kinda depends on this

### Landing Page

- Full page image
- Image rotates weekly?

### Featured Pieces

- Maybe have this at the top of articles? Could do something like netflix where they have a carousel of the featured ones up top?

### Articles

- Maybe do something like having all the images be different sizing rather than cropping
- The title of each article has a heavier font weight than everything else on the site
- Not sure how I feel about the font-size for the previous articles at the bottom of the page
- For Andrew's page, I think the bolded section titles should hug the paragraph underneath it rather than float in between the two paragraphs

### Our Team

- Lacks pictures
- Lots of space between nav menu and title

### Footer

- Only has IG icon
- Could include other things like submit, email, etc.

### General Notes

- I think the display font is a bit hard to reach on heavier font weights, maybe increase letter spacing?
- Maybe consider like a green and beige color scheme, more nature-y??
- Having IG logo on nav menu as well as footer feels a bit redundant
- Idk if y'all have a logo but could be nice as icon and replace the top nav menu text
- Burger menu is so clean on tablet/phone
